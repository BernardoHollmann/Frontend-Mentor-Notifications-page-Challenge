# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page

This is a solution to the Notifications page challenge(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Notifications page
  - The challenge consisted in replicating Notifications page for a desktop and mobile view perspective. See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Javascript
  - This was a good one to practice. I have to say it was a little bit tricky to stylish all the elements. As there were a lot of elements for this project, each one had to be thought almost individually. Honestly, I didn't too much about how this would fit into a future application. I just tried to compleat the challenge with the necessary HTML and CSS. The Javascript part was not that hard, but I took me some time to realise how to count the unread messages and place it in the according field. The overall result is good, I think.
